# Asepe Homes - Energy Monitoring System

A Flutter-based smart home monitoring and control application that allows users to monitor power consumption and control relay switches remotely.

## Features

### Power Monitoring Screen

- **Real-time Power Monitoring**: Track power consumption across 3 different power lines
- **Automatic Data Refresh**: Updates every 2 minutes automatically
- **Manual Refresh**: Pull-to-refresh and refresh button for instant updates
- **Last Updated Timestamp**: Shows when data was last fetched
- **Visual Power Display**: Color-coded power cards with intuitive icons

### Relay Control Screen

- **3-Channel Relay Control**: Control up to 3 relay switches independently
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Immediate feedback on switch states
- **Bulk Operations**: Reset all relays at once with confirmation dialog
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages with user-friendly feedback
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during API operations
- **Offline Resilience**: Local state management with server synchronization

### User Interface

- **Material Design 3**: Modern, clean interface following Material Design guidelines
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for different screen sizes using Flutter ScreenUtil
- **Dark/Light Theme Support**: Automatic theme adaptation
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Intuitive refresh mechanism

- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with user feedback
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading state management across the app

## Configuration

### API Configuration

The application connects to a custom smart meter API

#### API Endpoints Used

- **Power Data**: `GET /MetricList` - Fetches power consumption metrics
- **Relay States**: `GET /RelayOptions` - Retrieves current relay states
- **Relay Control**: `PUT /RelayControl/{deviceId}/update` - Updates relay states
